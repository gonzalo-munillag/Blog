# What's in here?

Hi!

My name is Gonzalo Munilla Garrido, I am a PhD researching privacy preservation techniques, namely differential privacy.

This repository contains my own code with some of my experiments and ideas, and implementations of papers from other authors.  

I hope you enjoy the repo :) 

Cheers!
