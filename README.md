Hi!

I am a PhD student researching privacy preservation techniques, namely differential privacy.

This repository contains my own code with some of my experiments and ideas, and implementations of papers from other authors. I also attached a link to my current publications, see the table of content below. 

I hope you enjoy the repo :) 

Cheers!
